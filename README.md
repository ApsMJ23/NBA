# NBA

This web app first takes your credentials and then logs in to show you the current NBA teams and the players present in them.
The data is not accurate as I couldn't get any good quality free APIs.

This is my first complete project that I've done in 3 days using the django framework.
I've used 3 different APIs one to fetch the teams, one for the players and their images and one for the team logos.
